# Sales Dataset Exploration (Excel)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how raw sales data can be organized, cleaned, and analyzed in Microsoft Excel.  
The aim was to transform a simple spreadsheet into a source of insights by applying formulas, functions, and data visualization techniques.

The analysis highlights how well-structured datasets can drive data-informed decisions and support business strategies.

## Functions & Formulas
- **Core Functions**  
  - `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNTIF`, `IF` and nested formulas for automation.  
  - Lookup functions such as `VLOOKUP` and `INDEX-MATCH` for extracting relevant data.  

- **Conditional Formatting**  
  - Used color-based rules to emphasize sales trends, highlight high-performing products, and spot anomalies quickly.

## Pivot Tables & Dashboards
- Built **Pivot Tables** to summarize sales by region, category, and customer segment.  
- Created **Pivot Charts** for interactive exploration of revenue patterns, product performance, and growth over time.  
- Combined visuals and tables into a compact **dashboard** for at-a-glance insights.

## Key Insights
- Identified top-selling products and those contributing most to revenue.  
- Exposed regional variations in performance and customer preferences.  
- Simplified complex datasets into clear visual summaries for faster business decisions.

## Tools Applied
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning, analysis, and visualization)  

---

## Dataset Fields
The dataset contained the following columns:
- Transaction ID – unique identifier for each sale  
- Date – order date  
- Customer Name / Region / City  
- Product Category and Product Name  
- Quantity Sold & Unit Price  
- Discount Rate  
- Revenue (calculated field: Quantity × Unit Price – Discounts)

## Project Outcome
By structuring and analyzing the dataset, I produced actionable insights, created dynamic reports, and developed a repeatable workflow.  
The project shows how Excel can move beyond simple data entry and function as a powerful analysis tool for trend detection, decision-making, and performance evaluation.
